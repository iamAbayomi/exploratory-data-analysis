# Exploratory Data Analysis
This project is an exploratory data analysis on a credit card bank data set with over 10,000 entries, providing information about customers' demographics, financial status, educational background, and credit card usage. Originally containing 18 columns, it has been condensed to 12 for this study.

The data analyis showed that credit companies need to improve financial literacy since higher educational level does not improve financial literacy
